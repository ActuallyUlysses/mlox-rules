First time here, follow these steps:
1. make sure you have MLOX installed
2. run it once, a file `mlox_base.txt` will be created
3. download all three files from this repo.
- `mlox_base.txt` replaces the one that was just created
- `mlox_user.txt ` goes in the exact same directory
- `Update_Rules.bat` goes in your MLOX directory

After that, MLOX will fetch the rules from this repo whenever you run it.
Enjoy!
